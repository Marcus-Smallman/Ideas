info:
  description: This is version 1.0.0 of the Ideas API. Before the API is described it needs to be made clear that this is built using serverless functions. This means that it is not very RESTful. As such, the API has been designed in such a way that it is unique for this project. The patterns and design choices used are a first pass iteration and are sure to be updated if necessary.
